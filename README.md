Pinge is a Swift PNG decoder which is based on making the PNG format accessible
to the average person, rather than for making the most efficient decoder. The
idea is that the components of the PNG format should be clear from reading
through the source code of this framework. 

### Pinge?

In a world where they tell us that gif should be pronounce jif, I figure that
the initialism PNG should be an acronym pronounced Pinge (Portable Network
Jraphics).
